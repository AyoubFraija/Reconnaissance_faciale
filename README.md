## General Information
The facial recognition system captures real-time video feed from a webcam, detecting and recognizing faces using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm. The system systematically processes each frame to extract facial features, which are then compared against a pre-trained model to identify individuals. Upon successful recognition, the system logs the presence of the identified individuals into a MySQL database. Django orchestrates the entire process, managing user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates. As a final step, the recognized faces and their corresponding presence data are displayed on an interactive web dashboard, providing a comprehensive overview of attendance.
